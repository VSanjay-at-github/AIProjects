# Analysis of customer reviews and AirBnb Listings data

This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze Airbnb listings and customer reviews data. 
The goal is to extract meaningful insights from textual reviews and structured listing data to better understand customer experiences and preferences. 
By employing libraries such as TensorFlow, scikit-learn, NLTK, and matplotlib in a Python environment, this analysis not only highlights key factors 
influencing guest satisfaction but also predicts trends that could assist hosts in optimizing their offerings. The results from this project are
intended to aid both new and existing Airbnb hosts in enhancing guest experiences and improving the overall service quality.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up a copy of the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Follow these steps to get started:

### Prerequisites

Before you install the project, make sure you have the following:
- Python (version 3.8 or higher recommended) installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- pip (Python package installer), which usually comes with Python.
- Git, for cloning the repository. Install it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project_name.git
cd your_project_name
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
python your_test_script.py


### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- **Python**: The project is based on Python, so you'll need Python installed on your system. We recommend using Python 3.8 or higher.
- **pip**: Make sure you have pip installed, which is the Python package installer.

You will also need to install several Python libraries which are essential for machine learning and data analysis:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- 'nltk'
