There are several options to translate text into english. 
My investigation into the review text resulted in identification of 25 diffrent languages.
I looked at the following API / sites and tried to translate. 

Microsoft Translator Text API
    Needs to open an account. $200 free credit for first 3 months
Google API 
    Easy inteface. Support to more than 100 languages. Free for 3 months with give credit. 
    Privdes personal or service account. Personal trail account 
    provides transalation for singnificant number of text. Easy to call API.
Baidu 
    Does not provide an english interface 
Amazon API 
    Requires signing in to AWS 
Deep ML 
    Supports 32 languages. Can use API or upload text. Uploading text did nottransalte all languages into english 

Started with Google API since already familiar and API was east to use thru Python
A key needs to be downloaded and paseed thru API call each time a text is translated. 
Can autodetect language but that is another call. To save on calls I used python library to detect 
non english text and called API for those to translate. The API will not respond after some calls
and had to restart the program several times to complete the translations.
